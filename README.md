### Learning a new language

When learning a new language, you learn about:

- Learn a new paradigm
- Learn a new framework
- Community behind the language

### Why Rails

- Learning a new language and framework
- Different approach to develop Web app
- Work with MVC pattern
- Coding with OO language
- A language/framework that makes your life easier

### Ruby on Rails

- Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz) in the mid-nineties
- Was designed for developer happiness and productivity
- Really took off with the release of Ruby on Rails in 2005(David Heinemeier Hansson)

> Ruby introduced many concepts/features that made web development easier at the time. Other frameworks did implement features heavily inspired by Ruby on Rails

- Developer productivity
- Very Legible Code
- Develop a high-quality Web site rapidly
- Rich set of tooling and libraries out of the box
- Very good database functionality (ActiveRecord)
- Lots of abstraction

### Comparison between Ruby and JS
